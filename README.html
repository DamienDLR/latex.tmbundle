<h1>A short guide to the mysteries of the LaTeX Bundle</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The LaTeX Bundle has a long history, it was one of the earliest contributed bundles in the TextMate family.  Many people have contributed to this bundle over the short life of TextMate.  Those people are documented in the credits section based on the now defunct history file and what can be gleaned from the subversion logs and mailing list.  Since there are several ways to use the LaTeX bundle and several different distributions of TeX out there for the Mac now seems like as good a time as any to document some of the prerequisites and options.</p>

<p>First, you need a working version of LaTeX.  Some of the commands in the bundle assume that you are using the latest version that you can get using the i-installer package.  You should install the 2005 install package from Gerben's i-Directory.</p>

<p>Several of the commands also assume that you have some kind of pdf previewer. There are four options:</p>
<nl>
<li>The HTML output window of TextMate using the PDF Browser Plugin</li>
<li>The TeXShop Application</li>
<li>The TeXniscope previewer</li>
</nl>

The LaTeX bundle also works pretty well with bibtex.  In particular the Bibdesk application for managing bibliography files works well with TextMate.

<p>You can find all of the above on Version Tracker and the like.</p>

<p>The rest of this document is broken into six sections.  There is a section for each of the following:  Commands, Macros, Snippets, Templates, Environment Variables, and Credits. Happy LaTeXing</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<ul>
    <li>PDF LaTeX:  typeset the current project to a temporary directory and display in the TextMate HTML output window</li>
    <li>LaTeX Comment</li>
    <li>LaTeX Uncomment:  I think these two may be obsoleted by the UnComment bundle</li>
    <li>Launch TexShop</li>
    <li>LaTeX and Preview Typeset the current project and display pdf using the system default pdf preview program, typically Apples Preview.app.</li>
    <li>LaTeX and TeXniscope: Typeset the current project in the project directory and disply using TeXniscope.  If you are a TeXniscope user you can set configure TextMate to be your external editor in the prefs panel for TeXniscope.  You should set the Editor to open, and the editor options should be as follows: "txmt://open?url=file://%file&amp;line=%line" Also if you are using TeXniscope you can make use of the pdfsync package.  \usepackage{pdfsync} in you LaTeX document.  This allows you to quickly navigate back and forth between the source and the preview window.  Command-clicking in the preview window brings you to the correct line in your source file.</li>
    <li>Find in TeXniscope:  Again, if you are using the pdfsync package this command will bring you to the preview window where the current line of source is displayed.</li>
    <li>BibDesk completion:  Searches in open bibliography files for the current word and replaces the current word with the appropriate cite key.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Macros</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Generic Completion:  This macro actually consists of a bunch of perl scripts that get run to do completion on bib entries, cross-refs and commands.  It is context sensative and makes its best guess based on context as to what you are trying to accomplish.</li>
    
</ul>
<h2>Snippets</h2>
The LaTeX bundle has many nice snippets that correspond to many of the commonly used LaTeX environments.  This is by no means complete, but users are encouraged to contribute additional useful snippets back to the bundle.  The Tab trigger for each is in brackets.
<ul>
    <li>Equation [Eeq]</li>
    <li>Equation array [Eea]</li>
    <li>Table [Table]</li>
    <li>Tabular [Tabular]</li>
    <li>Figure [Fig]</li>
    <li>Verbatim [Verb]</li>
    <li>Ref [ref]</li>
    <li>List (Itemize) [List]</li>
    <li>Item [It]</li>
    <li>Description [Desc]</li>
    <li>Item - Descrition  [itd]</li>
    <li>Enumerate [Enum]</li>
    <li>Code listing (lstlisting) [lst]</li>
    <li>Code listing inline (lstinline) [li]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Templates</h2>
The only template so far sets up a single file article document.

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<ul>
    <li>TM_LATEX_MASTER</li>
    <li>TM_TSCOPE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Related Commands</h2>
The Defaults bundle contains a set of commands called Special Items xxx.  The Special Items commands help you navigate quickly through the sections subsections, etc of a LaTeX file.

<h2>Credits</h2>

<h2>TODO</h2>
Once the new Syntax and Scope system is in place it would be good to rethink some of the keyboard shortcuts.
