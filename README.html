  <h1>A Short Guide to the Mysteries of the LaTeX Bundle</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>

  <p>The LaTeX Bundle has a long history, it was one of the
  earliest contributed bundles in the TextMate family. Many people
  have contributed to this bundle over the short life of TextMate.
  Those people are documented in the credits section based on the
  now defunct history file and what can be gleaned from the
  subversion logs and mailing list. Since there are several ways to
  use the LaTeX bundle and several different distributions of TeX
  out there for the Mac now seems like as good a time as any to
  document some of the prerequisites and options.</p>

  <p>First, you need a working version of LaTeX. Some of the
  commands in the bundle assume that you are using the latest
  version that you can get using the i-installer package. You
  should use the 2005 install package from Gerben's
  i-Directory.</p>

  <p>Several of the commands also assume that you have some kind of
  pdf previewer. There are four options:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The HTML output window of TextMate using the PDF Browser
    Plugin</li>

    <li>The TeXShop Application</li>

    <li>The TeXniscope previewer</li>

    <li>Apple's built in previewer</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Some of the previewers, TeXniscope and TeXShop work with the
  pdfsync package. The pdf sync package is a great because it
  allows you to easily hop back and forth between TextMate and the
  pdf version of your document</p>

  <p>The LaTeX bundle also works well with bibtex. In particular
  the Bibdesk application for managing bibliography files works
  well with TextMate.</p>

  <p>Spell Checking: The system spell check service works find with
  LaTeX but is a bit annoying since it will mark all the various
  LaTeX commands as misspelled. However, you can install CocoAspell
  which works as another system dictionary and is able to filter
  out LaTeX commands.</p>

  <p>You can find all of the above on Version Tracker and the
  like.</p>

  <p>The rest of this document is broken into six sections. There
  is a section for each of the following: Commands, Macros,
  Snippets, Templates, Environment Variables, and Credits. Happy
  LaTeXing</p>

  <h2>Commands</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>PDF LaTeX:</strong> [F3]</dt>

    <dd>typeset the current project to a temporary directory and
    display in the TextMate HTML output window</dd>

    <dt><strong>LaTeX Comment:</strong> [^/]</dt>

    <dt><strong>LaTeX Uncomment:</strong> [^?]</dt>

    <dd>I think these two may be obsoleted by the UnComment
    bundle</dd>

    <dt><strong>Launch TexShop:</strong> [cmd-sh-t]</dt>

    <dd>TeXShop is an excellent front end to LaTeX on the mac.
    TeXShop has its own built in editor but you can configure it to
    use an external editor. When you do this, TeXShop serves as a
    typesetting and previewing environment.</dd>

    <dt><strong>LaTeX Tidy:</strong> [opt-cmd-sh-l]</dt>

    <dd>Reformats your LaTeX code to be neat and tidy.</dd>

    <dt><strong>LaTeX and Preview:</strong> []</dt>

    <dd>Typeset the current project and display pdf using the
    system default pdf preview program, typically Apples
    Preview.app.</dd>

    <dt><strong>LaTeX and TeXniscope:</strong> [^-opt-cmd-l]</dt>

    <dd>
      Typeset the current project in the project directory and
      disply using TeXniscope. If you are a TeXniscope user you can
      configure TextMate to be your external editor in the prefs
      panel for TeXniscope. You should set the options as
      follows:<br>
      <pre>
    Editor: open
    Editor options: "txmt://open?url=file://%file&amp;line=%line" 
    
</pre>If you are using TeXniscope you can make use of the pdfsync
package. \usepackage{pdfsync} in you LaTeX document. This allows
you to quickly navigate back and forth between the source and the
preview window. Command-clicking in the preview window brings you
to the correct line in your source file.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Find in TeXniscope:</strong> [^-opt-cmd-o]</dt>

    <dd>Again, if you are using the pdfsync package this command
    will bring you to the preview window where the current line of
    source is displayed.</dd>

    <dt><strong>BibDesk completion:</strong> [opt-esc]</dt>

    <dd>Searches in open bibliography files for the current word
    and replaces the current word with the appropriate cite
    key.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Macros</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Generic Completion:</strong> [^-cmd-space]</dt>

    <dd>This macro actually consists of a bunch of perl scripts
    that get run to do completion on bib entries, cross-refs and
    commands. It is context sensative and makes its best guess
    based on context as to what you are trying to accomplish.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Snippets</h2>The LaTeX bundle has many nice snippets that
  correspond to many of the commonly used LaTeX environments. This
  is by no means complete, but users are encouraged to contribute
  additional useful snippets back to the bundle. The Tab trigger
  for each is in brackets.

  <ul>
    <li>Equation [Eeq]</li>

    <li>Equation array [Eea]</li>

    <li>Table [Table]</li>

    <li>Tabular [Tabular]</li>

    <li>Figure [Fig]</li>

    <li>Verbatim [Verb]</li>

    <li>Ref [ref]</li>

    <li>List (Itemize) [List]</li>

    <li>Item [It]</li>

    <li>Description [Desc]</li>

    <li>Item - Descrition [itd]</li>

    <li>Enumerate [Enum]</li>

    <li>Code listing (lstlisting) [lst]</li>

    <li>Code listing inline (lstinline) [li]</li>

    <li>Change Latex Style of selection [^-sh-w]: Makes it easy to
    wrap the selected text with \textbf, \textit, or \texttt</li>

    <li>Lines to List Environment [^-sh-l]: Wrap the selected group
    of lines inside a list
    environment(enumerate,itemize,description). Each non-blank line
    becomes an \item in the environment. If the first 20 characters
    of the line contain a : it is assumed that the environment will
    be a description environment and all the characters up to the :
    are placed inside left/right brackets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Templates</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Article</dt>

    <dd>Sets up a single file article document. Includes lots of
    nice packages for graphics, math, code listings, table of
    contents, etc.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Environment Variables</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>TM_LATEX_MASTER: If set this variable contains the filename
    of a LaTeX file that includes other LaTeX files to create a
    larger work. If not set, this variable defaults to
    TM_FILEPATH</li>

    <li>TM_TSCOPE: If set this variable contains the path to the
    TeXniscope application. If not set it defaults to
    /Applications</li>

    <li>TM_TEX: If set this variable contains the path to the tex
    program to use. It defaults to pdflatex</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Related Commands</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Defaults</dt>

    <dd>The Defaults Bundle contains a set of commands called
    Special Items xxx. The Special Items commands help you navigate
    quickly through the sections subsections, etc of a LaTeX
    file.</dd>

    <dt>Uncomment [cmd-']</dt>

    <dd>The Uncomment bundle toggles line comments for a single
    line or selected lines of text. It supports LaTeX and many
    other environments</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Credits</h2>There were at least two or possibly three
  versions of a LaTeX bundle floating around in the early days of
  TextMate by (I think): Normand Mousseau, Gaetan Le Guelvouit and
  Andrew Ellis At some point, January 2005, Eric Hsu pulled
  together the threads into one package. From then on there have
  been contributions by Sune Foldager, Brad Miller, Alan Odgaard,
  and Jeroen van der Ham. The Generic Completion package was
  written by Marcin.

  <h2>TODO</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Once the new Syntax and Scope system is in place it would
    be good to rethink some of the keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  </ul>
